Scenario: Logon Transaction
	Given I am logged in as "merchantuser@testmerchant1.co.uk" with password "123456" for Merchant "Test Merchant 1" for Estate "Test Estate 1" with client "merchantClient"
	When I perform the following transactions
	| DateTime | TransactionNumber | TransactionType | MerchantName    | DeviceIdentifier | EstateName    |
	| Today    | 1                 | Logon           | Test Merchant 1 | 123456789  | Test Estate 1 |
	
	Given I am logged in as "merchantuser@testmerchant2.co.uk" with password "123456" for Merchant "Test Merchant 2" for Estate "Test Estate 1" with client "merchantClient"
	When I perform the following transactions
	| DateTime | TransactionNumber | TransactionType | MerchantName    | DeviceIdentifier | EstateName    |
	| Today    | 2                 | Logon           | Test Merchant 2 | 123456789  | Test Estate 1 |
